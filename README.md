# specter
## Description:
specter is a bot that plays Clash of Clans. It's main feature is its attacking capabilities, allowing you fill up your storages while staying within a desired trophy range, as well as trophy push, all on its own. This project was inspired by the removal of troop training times, with the goal of seeing how far I can take a brand new account over the course of the summer (and maybe beyond).

I am using iPhone Mirroring on a Mac for an "emulator". With a few tweaks, it should work no problem on Bluestacks or other popular emulators, on any OS.

## Install all necessary packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
